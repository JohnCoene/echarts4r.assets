Assets for the [echarts4r](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com) package.

## Install

`echarts4r` is available from CRAN, `echarts4r.assets` is available from [Github](https://github.com/JohnCoene/echarts4r) only:

```r
install.packages("echarts4r")

# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("JohnCoene/echarts4r.assets")
```

## Note

This is a large package due to the size of the high fidelity textures it contains (currently holding 11.6Mb of assets), it might take a small minute to install. However, this does not mean that it crowds tyour envrionment, on the contrary it includes but a few functions.

## Example

```{r}
library(echarts4r)
library(echarts4r.assets)


```
